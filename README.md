# Brave Talk Bamboozler

A Chrome extension that tricks [Brave Talk](https://talk.brave.com) into thinking you're using Brave, even if you're actually using Chrome.

[Brave Talk](https://talk.brave.com) is a free, login-less and ad-free video conferencing service, but it comes with a catch: You can only start video calls if you're using the [Brave browser](https://brave.com/download/). This is a marketing stunt by [Brave Software](https://brave.com) to get more people into using Brave.

This Chrome extension lets you create video calls with [Brave Talk](https://talk.brave.com) even if you're not using Brave.

## Install the extension

1. Go to [this repository's releases](https://github.com/BenjaminAster/Brave-Talk-Bamboozler/releases).
1. Download the source code as `.zip` (Windows & MacOS) or `.tar.gz` (Linux).
1. Open the archive file you just downloaded and extract it.
1. Visit `chrome://extensions` in your browser.
1. Make sure that the `Developer mode` toggle is set to enabled.
1. Click on the `Load unpacked` button.
1. Open the folder containing the extracted source code of the extension.

That's it! You can now visit [talk.brave.com](https://talk.brave.com) in Chrome (or any other [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home/)-based browser) and start a video call there.
